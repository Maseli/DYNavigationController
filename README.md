DYNavigationController
======================

DYNavigationController is a [Backboard](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/backboard/id515564144?mt=8) inspired iOS control that enables navigation among UIViews based on swipe gestures.  With DYNavigationController, one can simply push and pop UIViews by swiping left or right. This makes it easy to create chromeless iOS apps.
